    repositories {
        // ... other repositories
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

## üöÄ Basic Usage

### SoftAP Provisioning Example

```typescript
import { useSoftapProvisioning, PTSecurity } from 'react-native-esp-prov-toolkit';

// Define your device prefix (e.g., "ESP_")
const DEVICE_PREFIX = "ESP_";

// Helper function to handle location permission denial
const alertForLocationPermissions = () => {
  Alert.alert(
    'Location Permission',
    'This app needs location services to work.',
    [
      { text: 'Settings', onPress: () => Linking.openSettings() },
      { text: 'OK', style: 'default' }
    ]
  );
};

function ProvisionScreen() {
  const {
    provState: currentState,
    provError,
    wifiList,
    provisionDevice,
  } = useSoftapProvisioning(
    10000, // scanInterval (ms)
    10000, // promptTimeoutMs
    DEVICE_PREFIX, // devicePrefix
    PTSecurity.SECURITY_0, // security level
    undefined, // username (optional)
    undefined, // proofOfPossession (optional)
    undefined, // softAPPassword (optional)
    alertForLocationPermissions // onLocationPermDenied callback
  );

  const handleProvision = async (ssid: string, password: string) => {
    try {
      await provisionDevice(ssid, password);
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  // Render different states based on currentState:
  // - 'searching': Initial state, waiting for device
  // - 'connecting': Connecting to device
  // - 'connected': Connected, ready to provision
  // - 'provisioning': Currently provisioning
  // - 'success': Provisioning successful
  // - 'failure': Provisioning failed
}
```

The provisioning process follows these steps:
1. Connect to the ESP device's SoftAP network from your phone's WiFi settings
2. The library will automatically detect and connect to the device
3. Once connected, you can scan for available WiFi networks
4. Select a network and provide credentials
5. The device will be provisioned with the selected network

## üìö API Reference

### Core Functions

#### Device Management
```typescript
// Search for ESP devices with given prefix
searchForESPDevices(
  devicePrefix: string,
  transport: PTTransport,
  security: PTSecurity
): Promise<string[]>

// Create a new ESP device instance
createESPDevice(
  deviceName: string,
  transport: PTTransport,
  security: PTSecurity,
  proofOfPossession?: string,
  softAPPassword?: string,
  username?: string
): Promise<void>

// Check if a device exists
doesESPDeviceExist(deviceName: string): boolean

// Get device information
getESPDevice(deviceName: string): PTDevice | undefined
```

#### Connection Management
```typescript
// Connect to an ESP device
connectToESPDevice(deviceName: string): Promise<PTSessionStatus>

// Disconnect from an ESP device
disconnectFromESPDevice(deviceName: string): void

// Check if session is established
isESPDeviceSessionEstablished(deviceName: string): boolean
```

#### WiFi Operations
```typescript
// Scan for available WiFi networks
scanWifiListOfESPDevice(deviceName: string): Promise<PTWifiEntry[]>

// Provision device with WiFi credentials
provisionESPDevice(
  deviceName: string,
  ssid: string,
  password: string
): Promise<PTProvisionStatus>

// Get current network SSID
getCurrentNetworkSSID(): string | undefined

// Get device's IPv4 address
getIPv4AddressOfESPDevice(deviceName: string): string | undefined
```

#### Location Permissions
```typescript
// Request location permission
requestLocationPermission(): void

// Get current location permission status
getCurrentLocationStatus(): PTLocationAccess

// Register callback for location status changes
registerLocationStatusCallback(
  callback: (access: PTLocationAccess) => boolean
): number

// Remove location status callback
removeLocationStatusCallback(id: number): boolean
```

### Enums and Types

```typescript
enum PTSecurity {
  SECURITY_0 = 0,
  SECURITY_1 = 1,
  SECURITY_2 = 2
}

enum PTTransport {
  TRANSPORT_SOFTAP = 0,
  TRANSPORT_BLE = 1
}

enum PTSessionStatus {
  CONNECTED = 0,
  DISCONNECTED = 1,
  CHECK_MANUALLY = 2
}

enum PTProvisionStatus {
  SUCCESS = 0,
  CONFIG_APPLIED = 1
}

enum PTLocationAccess {
  DENIED = 0,
  GRANTED = 1,
  LIMITED = 2
}
```

### Error Handling

All API functions throw `PTException` with specific error codes that can be translated to human-readable messages using `getErrorDescription(error: PTError): string`.

## üöß Current Status

- ‚úÖ iOS support available
- ‚úÖ Android support available
- üîÑ Active maintenance and updates

## ü§î Why Workarounds Instead of Fixes?

The Espressif libraries present some architectural challenges:
- Limited access to internal components (private/fileprivate)
- Architectural limitations that prevent direct fixes
- No ability to extend certain critical components

We've implemented workarounds to ensure stability and functionality. However, if there's community interest, we're open to creating a new branch where we can:
- Rewrite the iOS/Android libraries from scratch
- Implement proper fixes at the root level
- Create a more maintainable and extensible solution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Problems

- **Bluetooth Adapter Issues** üì±
  - Hangs when Bluetooth adapter is killed from settings during operation (both iOS and Android)
  - iOS: Prompts and hangs if Bluetooth is off in settings
  - Android: Fails with native error if Bluetooth is off in settings
  - Connect ‚Üí Disconnect ‚Üí Connect cycles can cause failures due to Bluetooth adapter object reuse

### Solutions and Best Practices

1. **Prevent Hangs** ‚è±Ô∏è
   - Race every operation's promise with a timeout to prevent hanging
   - Example:
   ```typescript
   const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) => 
     setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Operation timed out')), 5000)
   );
   await Promise.race([operation, timeout]);
   ```

2. **Device Instance Management** üîÑ
   - Create new device instances for each provisioning cycle
   - Follow this pattern: Create ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Scan ‚Üí Provision
   - Do not reuse device instances after completing operations
   - Always include the create step in each cycle

## üìã TODO

- **CI/CD Improvements** üîÑ
  - Fix iOS CI pipeline
  - Add CI jobs for example project testing
    - Install and run example project on iOS
    - Install and run example project on Android

- **Bluetooth Enhancements** üì±
  - Add BLE adapter status check
    - Raise appropriate exceptions when adapter is off
  - Improve BLE permission error handling in iOS
  - Fix permission annotations on Android 

## üîÆ Future Plans

- Community-driven improvements
- Potential ground-up rewrite based on community interest
